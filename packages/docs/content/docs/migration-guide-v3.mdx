Static CMS v3 introduces:
- Mobile support
- Depedent fields (see [Field Conditions](/docs/widgets#field-conditions) for more information)
- Live previews for react based projects <BetaImage /> (see [Live Previews](/docs/live-previews) for more information)

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps for upgrading to Static CMS v3.

Please [report any issues](https://github.com/StaticJsCMS/static-cms/issues/new) you encounter while upgrading to Static CMS v3.

## Installing

To install the latest version of Static CMS:

```bash
npm install @staticcms/core@^3.0.0
```

Or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @staticcms/core@^3.0.0
```

If you are using a CDN to load Static CMS, simply change your URLs:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^3.0.0/dist/main.css" />
```

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@staticcms/app@^3.0.0/dist/static-cms-app.js"></script>
```

## Gitea Backend Update <BetaImage />

While still remaining in beta, the Gitea backend has been evolving. This update switches the authentication mechanism to PKCE auth and improves performance when dealing with multiple file commits.

To use Gitea with Static CMS v3, you need to update your Gitea instance to at least `v1.20`. You will also need to update your config to match the setup for PKCE authentication. See [Gitea authentication](/docs/gitea-backend#authentication).

## CMS Events <BetaImage />

CMS Events have undergone a significant refactor in this update, including adding a new `change` event. You may need to update your config as follows to continue to use them. The `preSave` and `postSave` events along with the new `change` event, now require a `collection` be provided during registration, with an optional `file` if you are targeting a [file collection](/docs/collection-types#file-collections). All events now can handle async handlers as well.

**Old setup**

```js
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'preSave',
  handler: ({ entry }) => {
    return {
      ...entry,
      data: {
        ...entry.data,
        title: 'new title',
      },
    };
  },
});
```

**New Setup**

```js
CMS.registerEventListener({
  name: 'preSave',
  collection: 'posts',
  handler: ({ data: { entry } }) => {
    return {
      ...entry.data,
      title: 'new title',
    };
  },
});
```

See [CMS Events](/docs/beta-features#registering-to-cms-events) for more details.
