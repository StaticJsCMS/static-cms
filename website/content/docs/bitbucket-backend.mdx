- **Name**: `bitbucket`

For repositories stored on Bitbucket, the `bitbucket` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their Bitbucket account. Note that all users must have write access to your content repository for this to work.

## Authentication

To enable Bitbucket authentication it:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Static CMS `config.yml` file:

```yaml
backend:
  name: bitbucket
  repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your Bitbucket repository
```
