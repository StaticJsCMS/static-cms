All editable content types are defined in the `collections` field of your `config.yml` file, and display in the left sidebar of the Content page of the editor UI.

Collections come in two main types: `folder` and `files`.

## Folder collections

Folder collections represent one or more files with the same format, fields, and configuration options, all stored within the same folder in the repository. You might use a folder collection for blog posts, product pages, author data files, etc.

Unlike file collections, folder collections have the option to allow editors to create new items in the collection. This is set by the boolean `create` field.

**Note:** Folder collections must have at least one field with the name `title` for creating new entry slugs. That field should use the default `string` widget. The `label` for the field can be any string value. If you wish to use a different field as your identifier, set `identifier_field` to the field name. See the [Collections reference doc](/docs/configuration-options/#collections) for details on how collections and fields are configured. If you forget to add this field, you will get an error that your collection "must have a field that is a valid entry identifier".

### Examples

#### Basic

```yaml
collections:
  - name: blog
    label: Blog
    folder: _posts/blog
    create: true
    fields:
      - name: title
        label: Title
        widget: string
      - name: date
        label: Publish Date
        widget: datetime
      - name: thumbnail
        label: Featured Image
        widget: image
      - name: body
        label: Body
        widget: 'markdown
```

#### With Identifier Field

```yaml
- name: 'blog'
  label: 'Blog'
  folder: '_posts/blog'
  create: true
  identifier_field: name
  fields:
    - name: name
      label: Name
      widget: string
    - name: date
      label: Publish Date
      widget: datetime
    - name: thumbnail
      label: Featured Image
      widget: image
    - name: body
      label: Body
      widget: markdown
```

### Filtered folder collections

The entries for any folder collection can be filtered based on the value of a single field. By filtering a folder into different collections, you can manage files with different fields, options, extensions, etc. in the same folder.

The `filter` option requires two fields:

- `field`: The name of the collection field to filter on.
- `value`: The desired field value.

The example below creates two collections in the same folder, filtered by the `language` field. The first collection includes posts with `language: en`, and the second, with `language: es`.

```yaml
collections:
  - name: 'english_posts'
    label: 'Blog in English'
    folder: '_posts'
    create: true
    filter:
      field: language
      value: en
    fields:
      - name: language
        label: Language
        widget: select
        options: ['en', 'es']
      - name: title
        label: Title
        widget: string
      - name: body
        label: Content
        widget: markdown
  - name: spanish_posts
    label: Blog en Español
    folder: _posts
    create: true
    filter:
      field: language
      value: es
    fields:
      - name: language
        label: Lenguaje
        widget: select
        options: ['en', 'es']
      - name: title
        label: Titulo
        widget: string
      - name: body
        label: Contenido
        widget: markdown
```

### Folder Collections Path <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Beta%20Feature-blue" alt="Beta Feature. Use at your own risk" title="Beta Feature. Use at your own risk" />

By default the CMS stores folder collection content under the folder specified in the collection setting.

For example configuring `folder: posts` for a collection will save the content under `posts/post-title.md`.

You can now specify an additional `path` template (similar to the `slug` template) to control the content destination.

This allows saving content in subfolders, e.g. configuring `path: '{{year}}/{{slug}}'` will save the content under `posts/2019/post-title.md`.

#### Media and Public Folder

By default the CMS stores media files for all collections under a global `media_folder` directory as specified in the configuration.

When using the global `media_folder` directory any entry field that points to a media file will use the absolute path to the published file as designated by the `public_folder` configuration.

For example configuring:

```yaml
media_folder: static/media
public_folder: /media
```

And saving an entry with an image named `image.png` will result in the image being saved under `static/media/image.png` and relevant entry fields populated with the value of `/media/image.png`.

Some static site generators (e.g. Gatsby) work best when using relative image paths.

This can now be achieved using a per collection `media_folder` configuration which specifies a relative media folder for the collection.

For example, the following configuration will result in media files being saved in the same directory as the entry, and the image field being populated with the relative path to the image.

```yaml
media_folder: static/media
public_folder: /media
collections:
  - name: posts
    label: Posts
    label_singular: 'Post'
    folder: content/posts
    path: '{{slug}}/index'
    media_folder: ''
    public_folder: ''
    fields:
      - label: Title
        name: title
        widget: string
      - label: 'Cover Image'
        name: 'image'
        widget: 'image'
```

More specifically, saving an entry with a title of `example post` with an image named `image.png` will result in a directory structure of:

```bash
content
  posts
    example-post
      index.md
      image.png
```

And for the image field being populated with a value of `image.png`.

**Note: When specifying a `path` on a folder collection, `media_folder` defaults to an empty string.**

##### Available Template Tags

Supports all of the [`slug` templates](/docs/configuration-options#slug) and:

* `{{dirname}}` The path to the file's parent directory, relative to the collection's `folder`.
* `{{filename}}` The file name without the extension part.
* `{{extension}}` The file extension.
* `{{media_folder}}` The global `media_folder`.
* `{{public_folder}}` The global `public_folder`.

### Nested Collections <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Beta%20Feature-blue" alt="Beta Feature. Use at your own risk" title="Beta Feature. Use at your own risk" />

[Nested collections](/docs/beta-features/#nested-collections) is a beta feature that allows a folder collection to show a nested structure of entries and edit the locations of the entries. This feature is useful when you have a complex folder structure and may not want to create separate collections for every directory. As it is in beta, please use with discretion.

## File Collections

A `files` collection contains one or more uniquely configured files. Unlike items in `folder` collections, which repeat the same configuration over all files in the folder, each item in a `files` collection has an explicitly set path, filename, and configuration. This can be useful for unique files with a custom set of fields, like a settings file or a custom landing page with a unique content structure.

When configuring a `files` collection, configure each file in the collection separately, and list them under the `files` field of the collection. Each file has its own list of `fields` and a unique filepath specified in the `file` field (relative to the base of the repo).

**Note:** Files listed in a file collection must already exist in the hosted repository branch set in your Static CMS [backend configuration](/docs/backends-overview). Files must also have a valid value for the file type. For example, an empty file works as valid YAML, but a JSON file must have a non-empty value to be valid, such as an empty object.

### Example

```yaml
collections:
  - name: pages
    label: Pages
    files:
      - name: about
        label: About Page
        file: site/content/about.yml
        fields:
          - name: title
            label: Title
            widget: string
          - name: intro
            label: Intro
            widget: markdown
          - name: team
            label: Team
            widget: list
            fields:
              - name: name
                label: Name
                widget: string
              - name: position
                label: Position
                widget: string
              - name: photo
                label: Photo
                widget: image
      - name: locations
        label: Locations Page
        file: site/content/locations.yml
        fields:
          - name: title
            label: Title
            widget: string
          - name: intro
            label: Intro
            widget: markdown
          - name: locations
            label: Locations
            widget: list
            fields:
              - name: name
                label: Name
                widget: string
              - name: address
                label: Address
                widget: string
```
