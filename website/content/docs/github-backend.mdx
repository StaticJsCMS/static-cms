- **Name**: `github`

For repositories stored on GitHub, the `github` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to your content repository for this to work.

## Authentication

Because Github requires a server for authentication, Netlify facilitates basic GitHub authentication.

To enable basic GitHub authentication:

1. Follow the authentication provider setup steps in the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers/#using-an-authentication-provider).
2. Add the following lines to your Static CMS `config.yml` file:

```yaml
backend:
  name: github
  repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitHub repository
  # optional, defaults to main
  # branch: main
```

## Git Large File Storage (LFS)

Please note that the GitHub backend **does not** support [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
