For repositories stored on GitLab, the `gitlab` backend allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitLab account. Note that all users must have push access to your content repository for this to work.

**Note:** GitLab default branch is protected by default, thus typically requires `maintainer` permissions in order for users to have push access.

## Authentication

With GitLab's PKCE authorization, users can authenticate with GitLab directly from the client. To do this:

1. Follow the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#adding-an-application-through-the-profile) to add your Static CMS instance as an OAuth application and uncheck the **Confidential** checkbox. For the **Redirect URI**, enter the address where you access Static CMS, for example, `https://www.mysite.com/admin/`. For scope, select `api`.
2. GitLab gives you an **Application ID**. Copy this ID and enter it in your Static CMS `config.yml` file, along with the following settings:

   ```yaml
   backend:
     title: gitlab
     repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitLab repository
     auth_type: pkce # Required for pkce
     app_id: your-app-id # Application ID from your GitLab settings
   ```

   You can also use PKCE Authorization with a self-hosted GitLab instance. This requires adding `api_root`, `base_url`, and `auth_endpoint` fields:

   ```yaml
   backend:
     title: gitlab
     repo: owner-name/repo-name # Path to your GitLab repository
     auth_type: pkce # Required for pkce
     app_id: your-app-id # Application ID from your GitLab settings
     api_root: https://my-hosted-gitlab-instance.com/api/v4
     base_url: https://my-hosted-gitlab-instance.com
     auth_endpoint: oauth/authorize
   ```
