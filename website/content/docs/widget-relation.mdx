## Overview

- **Name:** `relation`
- **UI:** Text input with search result dropdown
- **Data type:** Data type of the value pulled from the related collection item

The relation widget allows you to reference items from another collection. It provides a search input with a list of entries from the collection you're referencing, and the list automatically updates with matched entries based on what you've typed.

| search_fields  | list of strings      |         | List of one or more names of fields in the referenced collection to search for the typed value. Syntax to reference nested fields is similar to that of _value_field_                                                                                     |

| file           | string               |         | _Optional_. Allows referencing a specific file when the referenced collection is a files collection                                                                                                                                                       |
| display_fields | list of strings      |         | _Optional_. list of one or more names of fields in the referenced collection that will render in the autocomplete menu of the control. Defaults to `value_field`. Syntax to reference nested fields is similar to that of _value_field_                   |

| min            | number               |         | _Optional_. Minimum number of items. Ignored if **multiple** is `false`                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Examples

### Referencing A Folder Collection

_Assuming a separate "authors" collection with "name" and "twitterHandle" fields with subfields "first" and "last" for the "name" field._

```yaml
name: author
label: Post Author
widget: relation
collection: authors
search_fields: ['name.first', 'twitterHandle']
value_field: name.first
display_fields: ['twitterHandle', 'followerCount']
```

The generated UI input will search the authors collection by name and twitterHandle, and display each author's handle and follower count. On selection, the author's name is saved for the field.

### String Template

_Assuming a separate "authors" collection with "name" and "twitterHandle" fields with subfields "first" and "last" for the "name" field._

```yaml
name: author
label: Post Author
widget: relation
collection: authors
search_fields: ['name.first']
value_field: '{{slug}}'
display_fields: ['{{twitterHandle}} - {{followerCount}}']
```

The generated UI input will search the authors collection by name, and display each author's handle and follower count. On selection, the author entry slug is saved for the field.

### Referencing A File Collection List Field

_Assuming a separate "relation_files" collection with a file named "cities" with a list field "cities" with subfields "name" and "id"._

```yaml
name: city
label: City
widget: relation
collection: relation_files
file: cities
search_fields: ['cities.*.name']
display_fields: ['cities.*.name']
value_field: 'cities.*.id'
```

The generated UI input will search the cities file by city name, and display each city's name. On selection, the city id is saved for the field.
